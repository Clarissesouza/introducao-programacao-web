    <h1>titulo</h1>
    <p><b>paragrafo</b></p>
    <i><p>Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
        Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
        Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
        Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
        Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
        Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
        Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
        Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (yeah)</i></p>
        <pre><b>
            My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
            Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
            You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
            I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
            I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
            I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
            You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
            I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
            Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
            Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
            I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
            Think retail therapy my new addiction
            Whoever said money can't solve your problems
            Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
            They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
            Happiness is the same price as red bottoms
            My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
            The way it shine, I know you've seen it (you've seen it)
            I bought a crib just for the closet
            Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
